# py-lifx-cloud
Python project to connect to and use the LIFX cloud.

This is a Python 3-based implementation. I would like to use PycURL2, but it is not available under Py3, yet, so PycURL is good enough for my purposes (so far). There are otherwise no additional 3rd party library dependencies.

I have not made this a site-package install, yet. It just "runs" from command line.
